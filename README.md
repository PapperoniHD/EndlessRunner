During our C++ course I had big issues making my project work, and I had trouble understanding the workflow between C++ and Unreal as well as some personal issues and work during our course time. 
This resulted in having to completely remake the project from scratch three times. Where something would happen that made the previous version of the project completely broken. This took both a lot of time and effort, 
which made it impossible for me to be able to complete the assigment before GP3 and I thought I would put this project on hold until GP3 was over. However, for CSN reasons I had to complete this assignment as soon as possible. 
Therefore I've had to use blueprints on some things to save time. But I've gotten a lot of help from people in my class understanding the workflow for C++ and Unreal and I was able to make a character using C++ and now understand the synergy of
both using blueprints and C++ sufficiently while working overtime on both GP3 and this Endless Runner. 


Second Turn in: 

I improved the game by adding a two player mode and aswell as projectiles having a 25% chance to not spawn when dodged.
