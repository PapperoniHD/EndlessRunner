In this part I used c++ to create a character and a scoremanager.

The character was created with c++ where I used acharacter functions for input and uproperties. The scoremanager only takes an integer and adds 1 every tick. 

The rest was made in blueprint logic because of lack of time, where I've made a highscore system, projectile spawner, and main menu.
